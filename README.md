# SecureGameDesign - Exploring Security in the Video Game Industry

## Executive Summary
Video games provide a unique environment in cyber security.  The platfrom garners an array of different cyber security agents, motives, and 
opportunities.  This fact means the scope of defending video games is a vast and can prove difficult for small indie companies.  The
security problem in the gaming industry is only compounded by a security second mindset.  
Some of the different motives for hackers to pursue video games as a target are competitive natures(cheating to get an 
advantage), exploit and account sales, and game item economies that can be as high as hundreds of millions of dollars[1].  This paper will 
discuss the different vectors of attack that a game may face, and finally present a security minded framework to game development.  The 
goal of the framework is to ensure proper security controls are created from the beginning of the development cycle in order to limit loss 
of revenue or respect in perpetuity.
