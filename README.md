# SecureGameDesign - Exploring Security in the Video Game Industry

## Executive Summary
Video games provide a unique environment in cyber security.  The platform garners an array of different cyber security agents, motives, and 
opportunities.  This fact means the scope of defending video games is a vast and can prove difficult for small indie companies.  The
security problem in the gaming industry is only compounded by a profit first, security second mindset.  

Some of the different motives for hackers to pursue video games as a target are competitive natures(cheating to get an 
advantage), exploit and account sales, and game item economies that can be as high as hundreds of millions of dollars[1].  This project
will discuss the different vectors of attack that a game may face, and finally present a security minded framework to game development. 

The audience for this documentation is smaller game design studios and startups that don't necessarily have the resources to commit to 
security.  The goal of the framework/documentation is to ensure proper security controls are worked into the design of the video game, to 
reduce lost trust and income after the release of the game.  While this documentation will attempt to be thorough, it is designed to help 
developers overcome common hurdles in game security and not defeat every edge case possible.

## Project Timeline
- Investigation into industry and game design practices
- Investigation into game hacking
  - client exploits
  - server exploits
 - Investigation of deterant and detection
 - Creation of documentation geared towards small indie studios
 - Review of documentation
 - Presentation of materials
